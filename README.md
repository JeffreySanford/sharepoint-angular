1. **Presentation Layer**: Angular 15 SPA with Material Design 3 components
2. **Integration Layer**: SharePoint Framework web part providing native SharePoint integration
3. **API Layer**: NestJS backend services for data processing and external integrations
4. **Development Layer**: Unified webpack dev server with hot reload and integrated workbench

### Quick Start Guide

#### Prerequisites & System Requirements

**Required Software:**
- **Node.js v20 LTS** (20.x.x series) - Essential for compatibility and security
- **npm 10.0+** or **yarn 1.22+** - Package manager with workspace support
- **Git 2.30+** - Version control with modern authentication
- **Visual Studio Code** (recommended) - Enhanced TypeScript and Angular support

**SharePoint Development Environment:**
- **SharePoint Framework development environment** properly configured
- **Microsoft 365 Developer Tenant** with SharePoint Online access
- **SharePoint workbench** enabled for local development and testing

**Browser Compatibility:**
- **Chrome 90+**, **Firefox 88+**, **Edge 90+** - Modern browsers with ES2020+ support
- **JavaScript enabled** with local storage and service worker capabilities

#### Installation Process

**1. Repository Setup**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd sharepoint-uptime-platform

# Verify Node.js version
node --version  # Should be v20.x.x
npm --version   # Should be 10.x.x or higher
```

**2. Dependency Installation**
```bash
# Install root dependencies (SPFx and shared tools)
npm install

# Install Angular application dependencies
cd src/webparts/uptimeStatus/angularApp
npm install

# Install NestJS server dependencies  
cd ../../../../server
npm install

# Return to root directory
cd ..
```

**3. Development Environment Startup**

The platform provides a unified development experience through a single command:

```bash
# Start the complete development environment
npm start
```

This comprehensive startup command orchestrates:
- **NestJS API Server**: Launches on port 3000 with hot reload capabilities
- **Angular Development Server**: Builds and serves the Angular app with live reload
- **Webpack Dev Server**: Serves the unified environment on port 4200 with SPFx integration
- **SharePoint Workbench**: Integrated workbench experience without iframe limitations
- **API Proxy Configuration**: Seamless frontend-backend communication with CORS handling

**4. Application Access Points**

**Primary Development Environment:**
- **Main Application**: `http://localhost:4200` - Unified Angular app with SPFx integration
- **SharePoint Workbench**: Accessible directly within the Angular application interface
- **Hot Reload**: Automatic page refresh on file changes with state preservation

**API and Documentation:**
- **NestJS API Server**: `http://localhost:3000` - Backend services and data endpoints
- **API Documentation**: `http://localhost:3000/api` - Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- **Health Check Endpoint**: `http://localhost:3000/health` - System status verification

### Development Workflow

#### Unified Development Mode

The platform implements a revolutionary unified development approach that eliminates the traditional complexity of multi-server development environments:

**Single Port Architecture**: Instead of managing multiple development servers on different ports, the entire platform operates through `localhost:4200`, providing:
- Angular application served from the root path (`/`)
- SharePoint workbench integration without iframe restrictions
- Static asset serving from `/public` directory
- API proxy forwarding to the NestJS backend on port 3000

**Integrated Build Pipeline**: The development workflow automatically handles:
- TypeScript compilation for both Angular and SPFx components
- SCSS compilation with Material Design 3 theming
- Asset optimization and bundling through Webpack 5
- Source map generation for enhanced debugging capabilities

#### Production Build Process

**Angular Application Build:**
```bash
# Build Angular app for production
cd src/webparts/uptimeStatus/angularApp
npm run build:prod

# Output: dist/angularApp/ directory with optimized bundles
```

**SharePoint Framework Package:**
```bash
# Build SPFx solution for deployment
npm run build
npm run bundle --ship
npm run package-solution --ship

# Output: sharepoint/solution/ directory with .sppkg file
```

**NestJS API Deployment:**
```bash
# Build NestJS server for production
cd server
npm run build

# Output: dist/ directory with compiled Node.js application
```
