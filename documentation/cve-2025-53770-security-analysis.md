## üö® Critical SharePoint Vulnerability Overview

- **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-53770
- **Severity:** Critical (CVSS 9.8)
- **Publication:** July 20, 2025
- **Attack Vector:** Network
- **Authentication Required:** None
- **Impact:** Remote Code Execution
- **Affected Systems:** Microsoft SharePoint Server 2016, 2019, Subscription Edition

---

## üìã Executive Summary

CVE-2025-53770 is a critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in on-premises Microsoft SharePoint Server. It is part of the "ToolShell" exploit chain and has been actively exploited in the wild. The exploit chain includes:

- **Zero Authentication Required:** Attackers can exploit without valid credentials
- **Remote Code Execution:** Full server compromise possible
- **Active Exploitation:** Threat actors are actively targeting this vulnerability
- **Bypass Mechanism:** Exploits authentication bypass through malicious Referer headers
- **Persistent Backdoor:** Enables long-term access through cryptographic key theft

## üîç Technical Deep Dive

### Attack Chain Visualization

**Stage 1: Authentication Bypass (CVE-2025-53771)**
- POST request to `/layouts/15/ToolPane.aspx` with forged `Referer: /_layouts/SignOut.aspx` header.
- SharePoint trusts this referer, skipping authentication and form digest checks.
- **Result:** Unauthenticated access to privileged endpoints.

**Stage 2: Malicious File Upload & Deserialization (CVE-2025-53770)**
- Attacker uploads a malicious ASPX file (e.g., `spinstall0.aspx`) using crafted ViewState payloads.
- Server deserializes attacker-supplied ViewState data, signed using cryptographic keys.
- **Result:** Remote code execution (RCE).

**Stage 3: Cryptographic Key Extraction & Persistence**
- Uploaded web shell extracts the server‚Äôs machine keys (`ValidationKey` and `DecryptionKey`).
- Attackers can generate new, valid ViewState payloads, maintaining persistent access.
- **Result:** Long-term backdoor.

#### Attack Indicators
- **Network:** POST requests to `/layouts/15/ToolPane.aspx` with suspicious referer headers.
- **File System:** Unexpected ASPX files in SharePoint‚Äôs layouts directories.
- **Configuration:** Changes to machine keys, new service accounts, or scheduled tasks.

## üéØ Risk Assessment for This SharePoint Angular Application

**Current Risk Level:** LOW

### Why This Application Is Relatively Safe
- **SPFx Architecture:** Client-side, not server-side SharePoint. No legacy endpoints, no ViewState deserialization.
- **No ToolPane.aspx:** No legacy endpoints exposed.
- **No server-side ViewState:** No deserialization of user-supplied objects.

### Protected Architecture
- SPFx (Client-Side)
- Browser Execution (Modern)
- No legacy SharePoint server components
- No vulnerable endpoints (e.g., `/layouts/15/ToolPane.aspx`, `spinstall0.aspx`, ViewState processing)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Vulnerabilities Identified

While this application is **not vulnerable to CVE-2025-53770**, several security concerns were identified:

### ~~Critical: Deprecated Multer Dependency~~
- **Status:** Mitigated (Upgraded to Multer 2.x)
- **Risk Level:** ~~HIGH~~
- **Impact:** ~~File upload vulnerabilities, potential RCE~~

### Medium: XSS Vulnerability Potential
- **Status:** Mitigated (Security headers and input validation added)
- **Risk Level:** MEDIUM
- **Impact:** Cross-site scripting if dynamic content is added

### Low: Outdated SPFx Version
- **Status:** Not critical, but consider upgrading for future security patches
- **Risk Level:** LOW
- **Impact:** Missing security patches and features

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Measures

- Patch SharePoint servers immediately if used.
- Monitor for suspicious requests and files.
- Upgrade all dependencies (especially Multer).
- Sanitize all user input and avoid unsafe deserialization.
- Implement strong authentication and authorization.
- Add security headers and rate limiting.
- Regularly audit and scan for vulnerabilities.
- Educate your team on exploit chains and defense-in-depth.

## üìä Visual Summary

Below is a table summarizing the exploit chain and detection methods. Vulnerabilities that are not present or have been mitigated are shown with strikethrough:

| Stage | Exploit Mechanism | Impact | Detection |
|-------|------------------|--------|-----------|
| ~~1~~ | ~~Auth bypass via Referer~~ | ~~Unauthenticated access~~ | IIS logs, referer analysis |
| ~~2~~ | ~~Malicious ViewState upload~~ | ~~Remote code execution~~ | File system scan, ViewState validation |
| ~~3~~ | ~~Key extraction~~ | ~~Persistent backdoor~~ | Config diff, SIEM alerts |

*Strikethrough indicates vulnerabilities that are not present or have been mitigated in this codebase.*
